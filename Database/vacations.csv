15;"Puerto Rico Island";"It may be small, but Puerto Rico is perfectly formed and packs a personality punch. Your vacation package to Puerto Rico transports to the beautiful beaches and turquoise shores of the Caribbean. The capital, San Juan, is awash with colorful Colonial Spanish architecture and cobbled streets, while inland, the El Yunque rainforest is a tropical oasis abundant in flora and rare fauna. For relaxed resort fun, check out the sunsets on the west coast, or to see the world's brightest bioluminescent bay, pay a visit to the Culebra & Vieques islands as part of your all-inclusive vacation in Puerto Rico.";"61f58106-d056-4979-9367-6a80166f125b.jpeg";"2023-02-03";"2023-02-12";937.0
